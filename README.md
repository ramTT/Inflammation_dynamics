# Inflammation Dynamics post Spinal Cord injury

## Establishment of transplantation and sacrifice time points

**Aim:** Dynamics of inflammation was investigated over time in order to empirically determine the theoretically optimal time points for transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells following spinal cord injury (SCI). The optimal time point for evaluation was also investigated.   

**Study design:** A 75 kdyn SCI was delivered to Th10 in mice (C57Bl/6J). Gene expression of pro -and antiinflammatory targets was examined at 1, 3, 7 and 14 days post SCI.  

**Statistical analysis:**  

* *Normalisation:* Expression values were normalised to healthy control for each target, animal and time point separately. Mean expression of inflammation was calculated for each animal and time point. Biological replicates were used for all statistical calculations.   

* *Assumptions:* Normality was evaluated using Shapiro Wilk's test. Homogenity of variances was evaluated using Fligner Killeen's test.   

* *Multiple group comparison:* One way ANOVA was used given that data was normally distributed and variances were equal. Given that data was or was not normally distributed but variances were not equal Kruskal Wallis H test was used instead.   

* *Post hoc testing:* One-way ANOVA was evaluated post hoc using Tukey's post hoc test. Kruskal Wallis H test was evaluated post hoc using pair-wise Mann Whitney U tests with holm bonferroni correction.
